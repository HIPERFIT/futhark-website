Futhark still suffers from rather spartan documentation.  What we have
is assembled `at Read the Docs`_.  Among other things, you can find a
`language overview`_, `list of papers`_, and a set of manual pages.

If there is something you believe should be documented, but is not,
you are very welcome to report the omission as a bug on our bug
tracker.  See the page `Get Involved`_ for more information.
