This is where we post announcements or guides that do not fit anywhere
else.  Blog posts are not necessarily updated when the language and
compiler changes, so not all information may be up to date.  If you
find something that doesn't work, please notify us, and we'll fix it
(if it's small) or put a notice in the blog post.
