Apart from `going to FOSDEM`_, we have also had at talk proposal
accepted for the Research Track at `Lambda Days 2017`_ in Poland.
This will be fun - I have never been at a more industry-oriented
functional programming conference before.

Most of the Futhark presentations I have given so far have been
focused on the compiler, since that is the main subject of my
research.  This one, however, will talk about language design, the
programming style of functional array programming, some of the
performance challenges, and interoperability with the larger world.
