title: Futhark is going to FOSDEM'17

description: A Futhark presentation will be given at the HPC track at FOSDEM in 2017

`FOSDEM`_ is an annual meeting of hackers and others involved in free
and open source software development.  Taking place in Brussels, I try
to attend whenever I am able.  Ever since I first started working on
Futhark, I hoped to one day present it at FOSDEM.  But as FOSDEM is
not an academic conference, I wanted Futhark to be *useful* (or at
least *usable*) before presenting it.  While Futhark is still far from
done, I feel it has finally reached a level where I am comfortable
standing in front of strangers and claiming that this stuff is worth
paying attention to.  That is, we have `flashy demos`_ and enough
varied benchmarks to have solid evidence of good performance.

FOSDEM is organised as a large number of parallel tracks, each with
their own topic and more or less independently run.  I had hoped for a
track on functional programming or GPUs, but alas, there was no such
thing.  Instead, I submitted to the `track on high-performance
computing`_., and to my great pleasure (and some surprise), my `talk
proposal was accepted`_!

Looking at the other accepted talks, I will be in fine company indeed.
Most of the other talks seem to be on fairly mature systems that are
immediately useful in existing HPc systems.  I hope I will be able to
convince my audience of the potential of high-performance functional
programming, even if Futhark itself is still quite rough around the
edges.
