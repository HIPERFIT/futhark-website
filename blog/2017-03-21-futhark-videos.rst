The videos from two recent talks I gave on Futhark have now been made
available.  The one from FOSDEM is `here
<https://mirror.as35701.net/video.fosdem.org/2017/H.2213/functional_gpu_futhark.mp4>`_
(the audio is a bit funky; I must have messed up somehow - the missing
audio in the first couple of minutes is definitely my fault as I
forgot to wear a microphone), and the one from Lambda Days is `here
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN4_theSjcA>`_ (`the slides are also
available
<http://www.lambdadays.org/static/upload/media/1487329176914850troelshenriksenfutharkpresentation.pdf>`_).
